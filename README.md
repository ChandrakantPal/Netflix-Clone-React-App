# [Netflix Clone React App](https://netflixclonereact.netlify.app/)

This is a Netflix clone built with React. It uses the TMDB API to fetch movies and display them in a similar way to the Netflix website. The design of the app is intended to look and feel like the Netflix website.

## Get Started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the necessary dependencies:

``` 
npm install 
```

Next, create a .env file in the root directory and add your TMDB API key:
```
REACT_APP_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```
Finally, start the development server:
```
npm start
```

## Usage
Once the development server is running, you can view the app by navigating to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

Clicking on a movie card will play a YouTube trailer for the selected movie.
